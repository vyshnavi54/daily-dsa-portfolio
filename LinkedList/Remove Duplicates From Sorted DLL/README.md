Remove duplicates from a sorted DLL

Given a doubly linked list of n nodes sorted by values, remove duplicate nodes present in the linked list.

Examples:

Input: head: 1<->1<->1<->2<->3<->4
Output: 1<->2<->3<->4
Explanation: Only the first occurance of node with value 1 is retained along with other distinct values. 

Input: head: 1<->2<->2<->3<->3<->4<->4
Output: 1<->2<->3<->4
Explanation:
Only the first occurance of nodes with values 2, 3 and 4 are retained, rest repeating nodes are deleted.

Constraint:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
