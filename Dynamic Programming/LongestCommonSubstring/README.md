Longest Common Substring

Given two strings s1 and s2, determine the length of the longest substring that appears in both strings.

Examples:
Input: s1 = "ABCDGH", s2 = "ACDGHR"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest common substring is "CDGH" with a length of 4.

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "acb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest common substrings are "a", "b", "c" all having length 1.

Input: s1 = "YZ", s2 = "yz"
Output: 0
Explanation: Comparison is case-sensitive, so 'Y' ≠ 'y' and 'Z' ≠ 'z'. Hence, no common substring exists.

Constraints:
1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 103
Both strings consist only of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
